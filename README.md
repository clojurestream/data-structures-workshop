# Data Structures Workshop

One of the primary building blocks in Clojure is the set of built-in data structures, which are all immutable. These enable functional programming and leading to the simplicity that allows Clojure to do such impressive things. But how are these built? And how can they possibly be efficient?

## System Requirements

The only requirement for this workshop is a recent Clojure (JVM) version.
